I have created event description generater tool using ChatGpt API.

As of Now It's version 1 
We can use this tool in console itself and I have not used prompt.

In upcoming version I will include accurate prompting and UI too ;)

Setup
Run npm install to download required dependencies
Make sure you have an OpenAI API key. You will enter this into the web app when running queries.
Run npm run start. GraphGPT should open up in a new browser tab.

In .env file it contains API key as API_KEY=""
