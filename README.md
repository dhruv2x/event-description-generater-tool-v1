I have created event description generater tool using ChatGpt API.

As of Now It's version 1 
We can use this tool in console itself and I have not used prompt.

In upcoming version I will include accurate prompting and UI too ;)

Setup

1. Run npm install to download required dependencies
2. Make sure you have an OpenAI API key. 

In .env file it contains API key as API_KEY=""
